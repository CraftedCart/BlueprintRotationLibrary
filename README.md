BlueprintRotationLibrary
========================

A collection of blueprint nodes to work with Quaternions within Unreal Engine's Blueprint scripting

Just copy-n-paste the .cpp and .h files somewhere into your project's source, **and be sure to replace `PROJECTNAME_API`
with your own `_API` macro** in BlueprintRotationLibrary.h, line 8.

I don't care what you do with this, I put this into the public domain. It's mostly just wrappers around FQuat functions
anyway. <3

This project lives on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/CraftedCart/BlueprintRotationLibrary), however changes are synced over
